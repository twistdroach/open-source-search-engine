# open-source-search-engine
An open source web search engine and spider/crawler. This was once the codebase for a search engine called Gigablast, but the site is no longer operational.  This is a fork of the original codebase located at https://github.com/gigablast/open-source-search-engine

# Quick Start
To experiment, you can quickly launch via docker by running:
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 -it --rm moldybits/open-source-search-engine
```

If you wish to preserve data between runs, you can:
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 -it --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/var/gigablast/data0 moldybits/open-source-search-engine
```

# Major changes in this fork
* cleanup! - Moved sources that are actually used into `src` dir.  Everything else has been stuffed in the `junkdrawer` dir.
* More cleanup - formatting, removing TONS of commented code, fixing some segfaults.  This is ongoing...
* I have replaced the original `Makefile` with CMake.  This now installs the correct files required so you can execute `./gb` in the `build` directory and run a test server there without it borking your source dir.
* Stubbed out some testing functionality for building tests if this ever gets cleaned up enough to start making "real" changes.

# Building
This does not build on ARM and does not work correctly on modern versions of MacOS, though it looks like there once was support at one point in time.

# Issues & Pull Requests
Should be filed at https://github.com/twistdroach/open-source-search-engine

# Testing
Tests can be put in the tests directory.  I have written a few simple examples just to make sure it (mostly) works.

# Documentation
There are various docs located in the html directory.  The FAQ & developer.html are particularly interesting.
